# 5. Processing and Output
# When the submit button is pressed, and a file is uploaded, the text is extracted from the uploaded resume PDF using input_pdf_text. 
# Then, the get_gemini_repsonse function generates a response based on the input prompt and extracted text.
# The response, which contains the evaluation and suggestions, is displayed in the app as a subheader.
